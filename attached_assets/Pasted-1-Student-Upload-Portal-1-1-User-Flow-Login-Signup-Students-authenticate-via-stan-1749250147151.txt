1. 🧾 Student Upload Portal
1.1. User Flow

    Login/Signup

        Students authenticate via standard Django auth (or social login).

        Profile stores department, year, etc.

    Upload Form

        Fields: PDF file, Title*, Author(s), Department, Year*, Keywords (tag input).

        “*” = can be auto‑extracted if left blank.

    Client‑Side Validation

        File type/size check in JavaScript (e.g. ≤ 20 MB, .pdf only).

        Required metadata fields.

    Server‑Side Validation

        Double‑check file type/size.

        Virus scan hook (ClamAV integration) for extra security.

1.2. Auto‑Extraction Logic

    PDF Title/Author

        Use PyMuPDF or pdfminer to read document’s metadata header.

        Fallback: scan first page text for “Title: …” or largest-font text element.

    Keyword Extraction

        If student didn’t supply tags, run a simple RAKE/YAKE pass over abstract or intro.

        Limit to top 5 keywords; present them back to user for confirmation.

    Error Handling

        If extraction fails, flag the record and email alert to admin for manual fix.

1.3. File Storage & Backup

    Local Dev: MEDIA_ROOT/…

    Prod: S3‑compatible bucket via django-storages.

    Backups: Daily Bash cron that syncs bucket to backup server.

2. 🔍 Search & Filtering
2.1. Search Bar

    Basic full‑text search on title, author fields.

    Highlight matched terms in results.

2.2. Advanced Filters

    Department Dropdown

        Dynamically fetch departments from DB.

    Year Selector

        Multi‑select list or range slider (e.g., 2015–2025).

    Keyword Tags

        Clickable pills for each existing tag.

    Reset/Clear All button.

2.3. Technical Approaches

    Simple: Django ORM __icontains + .filter().

    Scalable: Integrate Elasticsearch or Django Haystack for true full‑text.

2.4. UX Considerations

    Instant search suggestions (“Did you mean…?”).

    “No results” page with tips & “Contact Admin” link.

3. 📥 Download System
3.1. Tracking Downloads

    On-click, route through a Django view:

        Increment download_count on ResearchPaper record.

        Log user, timestamp, paper ID in a separate DownloadLog table.

        Stream file to user (so direct URL can’t bypass count).

3.2. Permissions & Limits

    Only authenticated users can download.

    Optionally, per‑paper daily download limits (e.g., 5/day).

3.3. Security

    Use X-Accel-Redirect (nginx) or secure S3 presigned URLs to serve files.

    Prevent hotlinking or sharing by tying URL to session token.

4. 📊 Admin Analytics Dashboard
4.1. Metrics & KPIs

    Total Uploads vs. Downloads (time series chart).

    Top 10 Downloads (list/chart).

    Uploads per Department (bar chart).

    Yearly Trends (line chart of new uploads by year).

    Keyword Cloud (font‑size proportional to frequency).

4.2. Tools & Libraries

    Frontend Charts: Chart.js for simplicity or Plotly for interactivity.

    Backend Data Prep: Django ORM aggregation (.annotate(), .values()).

    Cache heavy queries with Redis.

4.3. Layout & UX

    Responsive grid of cards (Total Uploads, Total Downloads, Active Users).

    Drill‑down: click on “Computer Science” bar → show list of CS papers.

5. 🧑‍💼 Admin Panel
5.1. Core Functions

    CRUD for ResearchPaper, Department, Keywords, UserProfiles.

    Approval Workflow

        Pending uploads must be approved before public listing.

        Reviewer notes visible to uploader.

5.2. Data Export

    CSV Export: Download logs, paper metadata, user stats.

    PDF Reports: Use ReportLab or WeasyPrint to generate neat admin reports.

5.3. Security & Roles

    Superuser vs. Moderator roles.

    Role‑based access: only superusers can delete, moderators can approve/edit.

6. 🔐 User Roles & Permissions
Role	Can Upload	Can Download	Can Approve	Can Manage Users
Student	✓	✓		
Moderator	✓	✓	✓	
Administrator	✓	✓	✓	✓

    Use Django’s Groups & Permissions.

    Optional: integrate Django‑Guardian for object‑level permissions if needed.

7. 🏗️ Cross‑Cutting Concerns
7.1. Responsive Design

    Mobile‑first CSS with Bootstrap/Tailwind.

    Collapsible side nav for Analytics.

7.2. Logging & Monitoring

    Application logs via django‑logging to file/ELK stack.

    Uptime and error tracking with Sentry.

7.3. Testing & CI

    Unit Tests for models, forms, and view permissions.

    Integration Tests for file upload/download flows.

    GitHub Actions: run tests on each PR; deploy on merge to main.

7.4. Documentation

    Clear README with architecture diagram.

    API docs if you expose REST endpoints (e.g. via DRF + Swagger).

    User guide for admin dashboard.
